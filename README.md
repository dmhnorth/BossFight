BossFight
=========

A points based gaming system.

Created as an ongoing personal project post-university to explore Java, design patterns,
and attempt to utilise and refresh the concepts I
come across whilst reading and researching, such as design patterns.

Changes made due to study are referenced in the commit comments. 
Eg. cc is a reference to a change made due to 'Clean Code'.

The overall aim is to create a modular system or 
API that could be implemented within a computer game battle system.

The project is going to be ongoing and developed slowly, with potential input from friends.
