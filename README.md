A points based gaming system.

Created as an ongoing personal project post-university to explore Java 
and attempt to utilise the concepts of 'Clean Code' along with anything else I
come across.

Changes made due to study are referenced in the commit comments. 
Eg. cc is a reference to a change made due to 'Clean Code'.

The overall aim is to create a modular system or 
API that could be implemented within a computer game battle system.
