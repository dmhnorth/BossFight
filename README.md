NOTE (NOV 14): project currently on hold whilst redefining the specifications and a clear outline goal.

A points based gaming system.

Created as an ongoing personal project post-university to explore Java, design patterns,
and attempt to utilise and refresh the concepts I come across whilst reading and researching.

Changes made due to study are referenced in the commit comments. 
Eg. cc is a reference to a change made due to 'Clean Code'.

The overall aim is to create a modular system or eventually an
API that could be implemented within a computer game battle system.

Currently, there is very little JavaDoc as one of the main purposes of the project is
to practice effective naming of both classes and methods.
This is a cornerstone of 'Clean Code', and having been encouraged to maintain
significant amounts of JavaDoc throughout my Uni course, I felt it would be good
to try and create some truly readable code without comments/doc.

The project is going to be ongoing and developed slowly, with input from friends.
